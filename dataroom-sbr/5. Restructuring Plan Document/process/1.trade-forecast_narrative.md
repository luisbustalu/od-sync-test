# Trade Forecast Narrative - Historic Rivermill Business Transformation

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This forecast represents a business model transformation that has already been successfully implemented and demonstrated, not a speculative plan. Historic Rivermill has evolved from a traditional café/restaurant business generating $1.5M annually with food costs representing 35% of revenue, to a tourism destination where food serves as a supporting amenity while generating annualised $2.3M+ in revenue with food costs reduced to 20% of total revenue through strategic diversification rather than merely operational cuts.

The transformation's success is evidenced by sustained performance improvements that have already been realised over multiple months. May 2025 demonstrated 29% year-over-year growth in gross sales, June showed a temporary seasonal dip to 6% growth, and July 2025 returned to the same proven 29% growth level, confirming sustained transformation success rather than isolated performance spikes. This established performance baseline provides the foundation for forward projections that build upon already-achieved results rather than projecting untested improvements. The July 2025 performance of $201,972 represents proven, sustainable performance with 26.7% year-over-year growth from July 2024, achieved after four months of transformation implementation. This baseline serves as the foundation for all forward projections, with the 49.9% growth from FY25 to FY25/26 reflecting the transformation period's underperformance rather than aggressive future assumptions.

Historic Rivermill's current market position as Queensland's most influential tourism farm in social media marketing, combined with recent Best of Queensland Experience award recognition, reflects the venue's established success rather than aspirational planning. The business is actively expanding visitor areas to manage overcrowding and has already implemented significant infrastructure improvements including solar panel restoration, second pavilion electrification, and enhanced wedding venues. These developments support the forecast's growth assumptions while demonstrating the venue's operational maturity and market readiness.

However, this followed years of mismanagement by the previous leadership, which repositioned the venue as a speciality café instead of a tourism destination, neglected financial oversight, and maintained ineffective supplier and staffing arrangements. These issues culminated in February 2025, when the board appointed a new managing director to lead the transformation.

## 1. Scope

This forecast explains the factors affecting Historic Rivermill's Small Business Restructuring plan, covering revenue projections and growth methodology, cost structure and restructuring impacts, transformation strategy and market repositioning, marketing transformation and strategic partnerships, operational improvements and performance gains, and strategic context for financial assumptions. The document does not cover cash flow, funding needs, working capital, or detailed financial models, which are prepared separately using this forecast as their foundation.

## 2. Executive Summary

July 2025 performance of $201,972 in total trading income represents a 26.7% year-over-year increase from July 2024, marking Historic Rivermill's return to profitability after major operational changes. This performance reflects the stabilised transformation results achieved after four months of new management strategies implemented from April through June 2025 reached full effect. Most significantly, this July performance is not exceptional but rather represents the same 29% year-over-year (gross sale) growth rate already demonstrated in May 2025, proving sustained transformation success rather than a one-time outlier.

The July 2025 baseline represents proven, sustainable performance rather than a transformation spike, as evidenced by the consistent high-growth pattern demonstrated over multiple months. May 2025 achieved 29% year-over-year growth in gross sales, June showed a temporary seasonal dip to 6% growth, and July returned to the same proven 29% growth level, with the slight variation in trade income growth due to calculation differences. This pattern confirms the business has consistently achieved approximately 29% year-over-year growth rates across multiple months, establishing a reliable baseline for forward projections.

The core business shift from "café with farm elements" to "animal experience family destination with café service" has improved customer perception, increased extended visitor duration, and supported premium pricing while repositioning marketing to target families seeking traditional, connection-building experiences. New tourism offerings including gift shop operations, scenic rides, and horse shows have attracted both higher footfall numbers and increased per-customer spending, with continued expansion potential through water sports, educational school tours, and farm-stay accommodation. Wedding and private events are expected to further increase revenue, though additional investments remain necessary.

Key projections include tourism revenue growth through the experience-led model, profitability in FY 2026 with continued growth beyond, diverse income streams reducing single-source risk, and cost optimisation lowering operating and marketing expenditure. The 26.7% July 2025 YoY growth rate provides a solid foundation for forward projections, as this performance was achieved through systematic transformation initiatives already implemented and proven successful, making it a reliable baseline for future growth assumptions.

## 3. Business Transformation

The transformation was built upon the appointment of a new director in February 2025, with management actions beginning to take effect in May. July represents the fourth month since management actions were implemented and demonstrates the results of continuous management change. As of July 2025, Historic Rivermill's shift from café to tourism destination is approximately halfway complete, with significant progress achieved in operational restructuring, market repositioning, and infrastructure development. The forecast reflects this ongoing evolution rather than static assumptions.

### 3.1 Market Shift

FY 2024/25 results exposed fundamental problems including low per-visitor spend, weak market recognition, underperforming business units such as equestrian operations, and operational inefficiencies from casual-heavy staffing structures. These issues stemmed from over-reliance on food sales rather than leveraging unique animal experiences. The new model prioritises experience delivery including animal encounters, with food service positioned as a supporting amenity. Revenue from tourism offerings has increased sharply through gift shop operations including admission fees introduced since May while maintaining footfall levels, guided tours and animal activities, event and wedding bookings including corporate functions, and premium packages such as the one-hour picnic horse ride. With the food and beverage sector now positioned as secondary to tourism offerings, food costs represent approximately 20% of total revenue.

### 3.2 Infrastructure & Capacity

Key investments since July 2025:

* Solar panels on six roofs – lowering energy costs. They existed. Repaired.
* Restored power to second pavilion – enabling extended dining areas.
* Chapel garden enhancement for ceremonies - higher revenue for this primary wedding location expected next year
* Garden clean-ups including secret garden restoration - first wedding in this second wedding location is expected early next year
* Parking expansion behind tree lines, huge improve to the site's "Instagramability"

These raised capacity, visitor satisfaction, and tourism appeal.

## 4. Marketing Transformation

### 4.1 Strategic Partnership Conversion

The marketing approach has been fundamentally restructured since July 2025, centred around the conversion of the Institute of Design (Singapore) arrangement from a high-fee service provider to a strategic equity partnership.

The previous arrangement involved a $20,000 monthly marketing services contract with an eight-month history, while the new arrangement sees the Institute of Design committed to becoming a future investor and shareholder with an investment memo already secured, pending SBR approval. This strategic partnership enables discontinuation of monthly service fees while gaining access to Singapore tourism expertise and capital investment.

### 4.2 Direct Marketing Partnerships

The partnership conversion enables direct payment to marketing outlets, eliminating intermediary costs previously managed through the Institute of Design. Key direct partnerships include brand ambassador Tania Zaetta with a direct payment structure replacing previous agency arrangements, radio deals with Triple M and SeaFM through direct partnerships eliminating intermediary costs, and targeted travel media, school outreach, and campaigns for new Gold Coast residents, all managed through direct relationships.

## 5. Operational Improvements

### 5.1 Cost Optimisation

Savings have been achieved through removing the Operations Manager role to simplify management structure, removing the current Wedding Sales Manager and replacing this function with sales agents, and converting five casual positions to permanent staff to eliminate 25% casual loading premiums. The board resolved these terminations on 30 July 2025, with one-month notice maintaining summer operations stability while full labour savings commence in September 2025.

Removing the Operations Manager role creates a net savings situation where annual salary savings are partially offset by weekend casual staff costs. Weekend operations previously managed by the Operations Manager now require additional casual coverage to maintain operational standards during peak periods. Converting casual positions to permanent roles eliminates the 25% casual loading premium while maintaining the same operational coverage and ensuring weekend operational requirements are met efficiently. Converting five casual positions to permanent staff delivers annual savings of $48,300 through eliminating casual loading premiums while maintaining operational stability.

### 5.2 Equestrian & Events

Equestrian operations have moved from loss-making shows to tourism rides with safety and service upgrades. Strategic pricing adjustments have improved customer satisfaction while maintaining profitability, with the eight-minute casual ride pricing reduction eliminating previous queue resistance and now generating consistent demand. Horse shows were successfully introduced in July 2025, complementing the established tourism experience before September's planned admission pricing adjustment. This enhanced offering foundation supports the transition from initial admission pricing to optimised levels, building on demonstrated customer acceptance and expanded animal experiences. Equestrian operations now represent a strong, growing revenue stream generating over $25,000 in monthly trade income from horse activities, more than doubling the average prior to new management.

Wedding operations have been rebuilt with new executive leadership, redesigned products, and improved marketing strategies. The Wedding Sales Manager role was eliminated and replaced with The Arbour, a local wedding sales agent who now handles wedding sales, reducing costs while maintaining wedding business operations. The wedding business reconstruction utilises the new permanent team structure alongside the external agent, with bookings typically taking three to six months to convert to revenue. August through October 2025 will show minimal results, while November 2025 marks the beginning of gradual growth as bookings mature.

### 5.3 New Revenue Streams

New revenue streams include farmstay accommodation with premium features where first guest groups have already stayed, gift shop and museum operations for retail integration, and weekend ticketing to manage capacity and secure baseline income.

## 6. Strategic Investment Partnership

### 6.1 Institute of Design Conversion Details

The strategic transformation involves converting from a high-fee service provider generating approximately $330,000 annually to an equity partner with locked-in investment intention pending SBR approval. The eight-month service relationship has provided the foundation for partnership trust, with strategic value including Singapore tourism expertise, international market access, and operational capital injection. Partnership benefits include immediate elimination of monthly marketing service fees totalling $28,000 monthly, strategic access to Singapore tourism market expertise, committed investment capital pending restructuring approval, and maintained marketing effectiveness through direct outlet partnerships. This conversion represents a natural evolution from service provider to strategic partner, providing both immediate cost relief and long-term growth capital.

## 7. Financial Analysis

### 7.1 Revenue Structure & Business Model Transformation

This transformation represents a fundamental business model evolution rather than a cost-cutting exercise. Five main revenue streams now drive the business: tourism operations including admissions, activities, accommodation, and retail representing the largest share and all processed under the integrated Square Sales system for seamless guest experience; events and functions aided by sales and venue upgrades; weddings recovering from operational overhaul; food and beverage positioned as secondary to experience sales; and processing fees and incentives integrated with pricing structures.

The business model transformation explains the food cost percentage change from 35% to 20% of total revenue. Before FY25, the business operated primarily as a café/restaurant with food costs representing 35% of total revenue and a heavily food-focused revenue mix generating $1.5M annually. After FY25/26 onwards, the business transformed into a tourism destination with food costs reduced to 20% of total revenue through a tourism-focused revenue mix where food serves as a supporting amenity while generating $2.3M+ annually.

The food cost percentage reduction is not achieved by cutting food costs or improving efficiency, but rather by adding substantial tourism revenue streams that require minimal food inputs. Tourism admissions and activities generate revenue without food costs, accommodation bookings create revenue without food costs, retail sales generate revenue without food costs, while food service costs remain stable as total revenue grows significantly. The result sees food costs as a percentage of total revenue naturally decrease from 35% to 20% because the denominator grows much faster than the numerator, representing business model evolution rather than operational cost-cutting.

### 7.2 July 2025 Benchmark and Growth Periods

The July 2025 trade income of $201,972.61 represents a 26.7% increase from July 2024, reflecting four months of staged transformation. April 2025 focused on repositioning and cost control, May 2025 implemented infrastructure improvements and new pricing structures, June through July 2025 launched equestrian relaunch and family-focused marketing initiatives, July 2025 completed solar implementation, pavilion electrification, and new retail and accommodation offerings, with September 2025 marking the commencement of full labour savings. March 2025 performance was significantly impacted by Cyclone Alfred, which affected Southeast Queensland tourism operations.

The forecast shows three distinct periods that must be understood together. First, the 49.9% growth from FY25 ($1,526,223) to FY25/26 ($2,287,177) includes the transformation period where the business was underperforming. Second, the July 2025 baseline of $201,972 represents proven performance with 26.7% YoY growth. Third, forward projections from July 2025 build from this demonstrated baseline rather than assuming untested improvements. The apparent aggressiveness of the 49.9% FY25 to FY25/26 growth is misleading when viewed in isolation, as it reflects recovery from transformation underperformance rather than future growth assumptions.

### 7.3 Cost Structure

Direct costs include food at 20% of revenue, kitchen wages at 12%, and café costs at 1%. Labour costs comprise front-of-house wages at 23%, other staff at 10%, and superannuation at 4%. Annual savings total $320,700, including $254,400 from marketing restructuring, $48,300 from labour optimisation, and $18,000 from energy cost reductions through solar implementation. These savings are achieved through strategic restructuring including eliminating the Operations Manager position, converting marketing partnership to equity, and implementing solar energy rather than cutting essential operational costs.

The $600,000+ reduction in operating expenses is not achieved by cutting essential services or quality, but rather through strategic business restructuring. Operations Manager elimination sees Mike Wood's role eliminated with the director taking direct operational control, marketing partnership conversion transforms the Institute of Design from high-fee service provider to equity partner, energy efficiency improvements reduce annual energy costs by $18,000 through solar panels, labour optimisation converts permanent staff to eliminate 25% casual loading premiums, and wedding management replaces Sophie with external contractor at lower cost. The result sees operating expenses decrease from $1.8M to $1.5-1.6M annually while maintaining or improving service quality, with costs scaling with revenue while keeping ratios stable.

## 8. Market Position & Growth

Ticket value has increased approximately 20% per visitor, with horse shows adding weekend value and enabling higher pricing structures. The wildlife licence process is currently underway with in-house veterinary certification supporting this expansion. Historic Rivermill holds the highest-ranking farm position in Queensland by social media status and has recently received Best of Queensland Experience award recognition. The farmstay accommodation announcement received the highest engagement levels in company history, with projected bookings scaling throughout 2026. Partnerships have converted high-fee arrangements into profit-share models, while renewable energy implementation, premium accommodation development, and integrated retail operations create durable competitive advantages.

## 9. Additional Opportunities

### 9.1 Chalet Development and DA Process

Investors, specifically Singapore partners, have shown interest in financing lodging construction through profit-sharing arrangements. The project involves developing eight to ten chalets in a row, with the first row currently in the Development Application process. This infrastructure expansion would significantly enhance tourism offerings by extending visitor on-site time from hours to days, creating substantial additional revenue streams through both accommodation fees and prolonged engagement with existing services. The chalet development represents a major revenue multiplier that would transform the business model from day-visit destination to multi-day experience hub, with extended stays naturally increasing per-visitor spending across all existing services including equestrian activities, dining, retail, and event bookings. This project is only viable if SBR approval is granted, as it requires significant capital investment and regulatory approval through the DA process. test

### 9.2 Wildlife Licence Acquisition and Veterinary Certification

The wildlife licence process is currently underway with in-house veterinary certification supporting this expansion. The company already employs a full-time employee with veterinary certification who supports the acquisition of wildlife licences for additional animal species including kangaroos and koalas. Full-time veterinary staff with appropriate certification provide the foundation for expanding wildlife experiences beyond current farm animal offerings, enabling the company to offer premium wildlife encounters that command higher pricing and extend visitor duration.

The repositioning is far from reaching the point of diminishing returns, with current pricing at A$4.75 maintained throughout the forecast period. Internal research indicates that given the competitive context of Paradise Country at A$50 and Currumbin Wildlife Reserve at A$70, Historic Rivermill could potentially charge A$10 admission fee without significant reduction in footfall. However, this factor has been deliberately excluded from the forecast to avoid creating questions about whether the A$0 → A$4.75 story can repeat, and to maintain conservative, realistic projections based on proven performance. Pricing could potentially reach A$15 to A$20 as kangaroo or koala offerings are added through wildlife licences currently being prepared, representing significant revenue growth potential through premium wildlife experience offerings.

## 10. Conclusion

Historic Rivermill now possesses proven revenue improvement demonstrated by 26.7% growth in July 2025, cost structure stability through permanent staffing and direct partnerships, market leadership in Gold Coast tourism with highest-ranking farm status, award recognition providing official validation, strategic partnerships shifting from high-fee to equity investment models, infrastructure for sustained growth through renewable energy and enhanced facilities, and comprehensive cost savings of $320,700 annually from restructuring initiatives.

The Institute of Design conversion from service provider to equity partner provides both immediate cost relief and strategic capital injection, pending SBR approval. Profitability is expected from FY 2026 with steady growth continuing into FY 2027. All forecasts are based on confirmed performance and structural changes already implemented, making them realistic and conservative projections built upon demonstrated transformation success rather than speculative planning.
